# SmoothRide - Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy pertains to the use of the SmoothRide application, which is made available to users of Android devices for free and as is. Your use of the application constitutes your agreement to this Policy.

## Data use
SmoothRide does not collect, use or retain any information that could personally identify you as an individual or a business, nor does it access any such data from other applications or system utilities that may be installed on the same device.

The sensor data used by the application includes acceleration, rotation, and ambiant light data, but no location, audio, video or otherwise personally identifiable data.

The data is not used to estimate the velocity or location of the device. The data is not stored into files, cookies or any other form of data container, neither on the device nor any remote server, including but not limited to third-party analytics services.

## Policy updates
This Privacy Policy may occasionally be updated. It is therefore recommended that the users of the application review this page periodically for any changes.
